      Purple is, generally, any color with hue between red and blue. Blue-dominated hues may be classed as violet instead, especially in the United Kingdom.
<cite class="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple">
Purple has long been associated with royalty, originally because Tyrian purple dye, made from crushed shells, was extremely expensive in antiquity.[4] Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. Similarly in Japan, the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy.

According to contemporary surveys in Europe and the United States, purple is the color most often associated with rarity, royalty, magic, mystery and piety When combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity, and seduction.</cite>
